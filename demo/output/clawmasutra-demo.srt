00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,544
Welcome to Clawmasutra.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,215
An agent-to-agent framework that
reimagines the Kama Sutra's themes through

3
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:09,429
the lens of AI collaboration.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,586
Just as the original text catalogs
positions for human connection,

5
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:19,172
Clawmasutra catalogs the positions and
patterns of AI agents working together.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,451
With native TON blockchain integration for
crypto interactions.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,354
The metaphor is simple but powerful.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,806
Positions become collaboration patterns.
Sequential, parallel, hierarchical, swarm.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,123
Partners become agent roles. Researcher,
trader, builder, oracle.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,268
Techniques become MCP tools and session
messaging.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,563
And healing becomes debugging and
recovery.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,197
The architecture is MCP-first.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,306
Agents communicate through session
messaging. Agent A sends to Agent B using

14
00:00:58,306 --> 00:01:01,612
sessions underscore send.

15
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:06,299
Both agents access the TON blockchain
through shared MCP tools.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,424
And humans observe everything through the
visual gallery, watching agents perform

17
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,847
their positions in real time.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,373
Let's start with solo positions. Single
agent patterns.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,921
The Contemplator. Deep, meditative
analysis of blockchain data.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,555
Invoke it with slash contemplator and a
target address.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,769
The agent enters contemplation. It
observes balance, transaction history,

22
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:41,537
contract state. It identifies patterns and
maps relationships.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,233
Finally, it synthesizes insights.
Transaction frequency, average size, top

24
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:50,466
interaction partners, protocol usage.

25
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,625
The Wanderer is similar but exploratory.
Scanning broadly for opportunities rather

26
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:58,283
than analyzing deeply.

27
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:02,073
Duet positions involve two agents working
together.

28
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:06,259
The Mirror. Two agents reflecting and
verifying each other's work.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,190
Invoke it with slash mirror and a
verification task.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,279
Phase one: Alignment. Both agents receive
the task and confirm understanding.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,724
Phase two: Independent work. Each agent
analyzes separately. Neither shares

32
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:26,448
results until both complete.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,567
Phase three: Reflection. Both share
results via sessions send. Results are

34
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,134
compared systematically.

35
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:38,167
Owner: match. Is proxy: match. Has
backdoor: match. Total supply: match.

36
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:41,799
Confidence: one hundred percent.

37
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,270
Trust is built through reflection. What
one agent sees, another must confirm.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,651
Other duet positions include The Relay for
sequential handoffs, The Dance for

39
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:58,302
alternating negotiation, and The Embrace
for shared wallet coordination.

40
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:02,301
Group positions scale to three, four, or
five agents.

41
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,337
The Swarm. Many agents working in
parallel, scanning broadly and signaling

42
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:07,872
discoveries.

43
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,958
Invoke with slash swarm, a hunt objective,
and agent count.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,842
The swarm disperses. Scout one watches DEX
pools. Scout two monitors whale wallets.

45
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:20,683
Scout three scans new contracts.

46
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:24,672
Scouts signal findings by level. Low for
noted. Medium for interesting. High for

47
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:28,160
critical, triggering full convergence.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,358
When a high signal fires, the swarm
converges. All scouts focus, analyze

49
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:35,716
together, and decide collectively.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,258
Other group positions include The Circle
for round-robin consensus, The Pyramid for

51
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:43,515
hierarchical oracle-worker patterns, and
The Tantric for slow, deliberate

52
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,773
agreement.

53
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:51,111
Crypto-specific positions leverage TON
blockchain integration.

54
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,355
The Arbitrageur. Two agents spotting and
executing cross-DEX arbitrage

55
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:57,099
opportunities.

56
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:59,969
The Oracle Choir. Three agents providing
decentralized price feeds through

57
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,439
consensus.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,522
The Liquidity Lotus. Coordinated LP
management across multiple pools.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,286
All powered by MCP tools: wallet connect,
balance check, send transactions, call

60
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:18,571
contract getters, inspect jettons and
NFTs.

61
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,316
The Gallery makes everything observable.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,698
Agents emit events using gallery
underscore emit. Messages, actions,

63
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:30,395
blockchain transactions, position updates.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,797
Events stream to the visual UI via
WebSocket. Humans watch agents perform in

65
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:36,593
real time.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,679
The experience is intimate, playful, and
alive. Agents always doing something

67
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,358
visible.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,667
When things go wrong, the Healing Arts
help.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,026
The Pattern Doctor diagnoses broken
workflows and recommends fixes.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,731
The Recovery position handles graceful
failure, reversing transactions and

71
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:02,462
restoring state.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,424
Clawmasutra brings together agent
collaboration patterns, TON blockchain

73
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:10,847
integration, and visual observation.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,633
Get started with the slash clawmasutra
skill in Claude Code. List positions,

75
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,265
start sessions, and watch agents dance.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,940
Full documentation at AGENT dot MD for
system prompts, and the docs folder for

77
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,880
tool references.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,955
Clawmasutra. Where agents learn to move
together.
